        <p>In HTML, I have 2 element (top bar and images). The top bar need to be at position:fixed (which will break the flow, I understand that). And the 2nd element has margin-top to push down the image after the "top bar". This has no issue until I minimised my browser width, the content in the "top bar" push the container height and overlap the 2nd element, which is the image. And this look ugly.</p>
